Hi there,

Here are some simple instructions to get you going.
Copy and paste one of the following bits to your user preferences file.

Blue Monday:
{
  "theme": "Spacefunk (Blue Monday).sublime-theme",
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Spacefunk/Future Funk (Blue Monday).tmTheme"
}

Grey Tuesday:
{
  "theme": "Spacefunk (Grey Tuesday).sublime-theme",
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Spacefunk/Future Funk (Grey Tuesday).tmTheme"
}

Include an additional line for a light sidebar if you fancy:
{
  "spacefunk_sidebar_light": true
}

Restart Sublime Text to make sure all changes are applied.

Enjoy!
